_Perverse Academic Incentives_. Government agencies risk $200 billion in R&D per year. Start-ups [emerging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal) from this R&D draw in almost dollar-for-dollar venture capital investments. Most technological advancements scale-up the most promising of these efforts into peace-time, war-time, and money-time products and implements. But if we turn to **infrastructure**: no one's funding you to build infrastructure. NIH doesn’t give R01s for epistemic elegance. They want data, statistical significance, and a manuscript in NEJM. But MyST shines not in raw data—it excels at narrative explanation, cross-domain integration, reproducibility, and transparency. Until reproducibility gets financial incentives, MyST & `.ipynb` won’t have institutional traction.

_Digital vs. Analog_. Non-trivial question. One emergent phenomenon of this binary is a start-up brand called MAGA. And several emergent phenomena including the Kennedy's, autism, and more. Study the neural net above to see if you might deduce some specifics from its general riff. But one thing is for sure: start-ups are their boosters are very selective about the data they quote!
